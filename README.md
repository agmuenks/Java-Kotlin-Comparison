#Language purpose and genesis

##Java
Java was created as a language that could be portable and used on multiple platforms in different electronics. This was designed with distribution of applets on the World-Wide Web in mind. Java also addressed the problem of memory management through its garbage collection feature. Java was intended to have similar notation to C/C++, but offer platform independency and improved the ease of use.
