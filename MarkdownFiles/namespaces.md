# Namespaces

Both Java and Kotlin implement namespaces through packages. Packages act as folders that group similar classes. The package keyword is used in both languages to assign a package to a class in Java, or a class and function in Kotlin. Classes or functions from other packages can be imported to use in the current class or function with the import key word.

### Java
```java
package java.lang;

import java.util.ArrayList; //imports ArrayList class from java.util package
```

### Kotlin
```kotlin
package kotlin.io;

import kotlin.text.*; //imports all classes and functions in package
```
