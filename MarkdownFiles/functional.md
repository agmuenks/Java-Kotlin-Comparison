# Functional programming

### Java
While Java follows the OOP paradigm, it does allow the option for functional programming in Java 8 by using lambda expressions. More information of lambda expressions can be found [here.](lambdas.md) 

### Kotlin
Being a multi-paradigm language, Kotlin supports functional programming. Kotlin has features like [high order functions](lambdas.md) and treats functions as first class citizens which allow functional programming.
