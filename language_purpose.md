#Language purpose and genesis

##Java
Java was created as a language that could be portable and used on multiple platforms in different electronics. This was designed with distribution of applets on the World-Wide Web in mind. Java also addressed the problem of memory management through its garbage collection feature. Java was intended to have similar notation to C/C++, but offer platform independency and improved the ease of use.

##Kotlin
Kotlin was invented by JetBrains to improve upon Java. JetBrains develops programming tools and many of their applications were written in Java. After becoming frustrated with Java, they created Kotlin with the intention to be compatible with Java and implement features in other modern OO languages, such as eliminating risk of referencing a null value.
